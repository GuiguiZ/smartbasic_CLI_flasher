# smartbasic_CLI_flasher
A tool to flash your module with CLI (tested only on RM186 with python 2.7 on Linux)  
Usage: You must edit the following values directly inside of the python file:  
-Source file's path  
-Source file's name  
-Compiler 's path  
-Serial interface's path  
Once this done, just launch the python file, and press enter every time you want to reflash your module.

Todo: un-hardcode the values so to get more flexibility

Other requirements: You must have the XCOMPILER provided with laird firmware files, available at Laird's website


Use at you own risks, I'm not responsible if you buurn or brick your module.
